What is JSON?
Ans:- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured
data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications
(e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

JSON is used in electronic data exchange, such as transmitting data in web applications. Websites are made
of web pages. These web pages display pre-stored information in a server and interact with the server using 
data formats such as JSON.
