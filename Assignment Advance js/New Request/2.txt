What is promises?
Ans:- In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that will produce a single value some time in the future.
If the promise is successful, it will produce a resolved value, but if something goes wrong then it 
will produce a reason why the promise failed. The possible outcomes here are similar to that of promises in real life.

JavaScript promises can be in one of three possible states. These states indicate the progress of the promise. They are:

pending: This is the default state of a defined promise
fulfilled:  This is the state of a successful promise
rejected: This is the state of a failed promise

A promise goes from pending to fulfilled, or from pending to rejected—‘fulfilled’ and ‘rejected’ indicate 
the end of a promise.
