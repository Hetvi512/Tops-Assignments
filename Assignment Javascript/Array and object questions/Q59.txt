Q.59 What is Bom vs Dom in JS?

Ans:- BOM (Browser Object Model)

The BOM represents the browser environment and allows JavaScript to interact with the browser itself, rather than the content of the document. It provides access to browser-specific objects and functions, enabling control over the browser window and its components. The BOM is not standardized, so different browsers may implement it differently. Common BOM objects include:

window: Represents the browser window and provides methods to control it (e.g., window.open(), window.close(), window.alert()).
navigator: Provides information about the browser (e.g., navigator.userAgent, navigator.language).
location: Provides information about the current URL and allows navigation to different URLs (e.g., location.href, location.reload()).
history: Allows manipulation of the browser's session history (e.g., history.back(), history.forward(), history.go()).
screen: Provides information about the user's screen (e.g., screen.width, screen.height).


DOM (Document Object Model)

The DOM represents the structure and content of the HTML document, allowing JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the web page's elements. The DOM is a standard defined by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers. The DOM represents the document as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to a part of the document (e.g., elements, attributes, text).

Common DOM methods and properties include:

document: Represents the entire HTML document and serves as the entry point to the DOM (e.g., document.getElementById(), document.querySelector()).
Element: Represents an HTML element and provides methods to manipulate it (e.g., element.innerHTML, element.style, element.addEventListener()).
Node: Represents a generic node in the DOM tree (e.g., node.appendChild(), node.removeChild()).
