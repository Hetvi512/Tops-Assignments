Q.30 What are the looping structures in JavaScript? Any one Example?

There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: 
they repeat an action some number of times.In JavaScript, there are 7 types of loops that can
be used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Each loop has its own specific use case and syntax.

 for Loop
 while Loop
 do-while Loop
 for-in Loop
 for-of Loop
 forEach loop
 map Loop

 Example:

 for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}

// Output:
// Hello, world!
// Hello, world!
// Hello, world!
